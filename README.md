# Transport system
For the development of the project, I opted to use the Intellij Community Version as the integrated
development environment, coupled with JavaFX and Scenebuilder for the graphical user interface
design.

As for the databases, I chose to use XAMP, which includes both Apache and MySql. The decision to use
these technologies was based on their ease of use, versatility, and reliability.

The purpose of this project is to develop a transportation system that allows users to connect and
register in the system. The system will provide information about users, trucks, stops, and transported
cargo. The main goal is to create a platform that enables efficient management of transportation
services, including trip planning, driver and truck assignment, cargo tracking, and communication
among users.

The system will have two main types of users: drivers and managers, who will have different access
levels and capabilities. Drivers will be able to view and select available trips, trucks, and fill in relevant
information about their stops. Managers will have broader capabilities, such as creating new trips,
cargo records, and assigning drivers and trucks to trips.
